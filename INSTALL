                       Blender2Cal3d Installation


# INFO -----------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains two versions of a 'blender to cal3d' script. The
 original is the "blender2cal3d.py" script which works with Blender 2.49. The
 updated script is derived from this script and sits in the io_export_cal3d
 folder.

 The updated script works with Blender 2.58, but they are slightly different.



# INSTALL - Blender 2.58 -----------------------------------------------------

1) Dump the io_export_cal3d/ folder into your Blender installation directory
   under 2.5X/scripts/addons/.

   (For example, if you have downloaded blender manually, you might have
   something like

   ~/Downloads/blender-2.58a-linux-glibc27-i686/2.58/scripts/addons/

   whereas if you installed with a package manager, you might have something
   like

   /usr/share/blender/2.58/scripts/addons/

   Copy the entire io_export_cal3d folder like

   "cp -r io_export_cal3d/  /the/directory/of/the/addon/folder/"


2) Fire up Blender and go to
   [File -> User Preferences -> Addons -> Import/Export].

   Now click to enable the Cal3d exporter. You should be able to export to
   Cal3d format by going to  [File -> Export -> Cal3D (.cfg) ].


# NOTES

1) Alternatively, one can load the addon directly using the button in
   [File -> User Preferences -> Addons -> Import/Export]. If you want to make
   changes to the script you will still have to hunt down the addon folder.

2) The easiest way to see if errors have occured while using the script is to
   open blender in a console so that you get error messages like:

.....

[hal@computer blender-2.58a-linux-glibc27-i686]$ ./blender
AL lib: pulseaudio.c:331: PulseAudio returned minreq > tlength/2; expect break up
found bundled python: /home/hal/Downloads/blender-2.58a-linux-glibc27-i686/2.58/python
read blend: /home/hal/Project/Models/Basic_model.blend
###### ERROR DURING ARMATURE EXPORT ######
Only one root bone is supported

....

   otherwise, errors are silently ignored.



# INSTALL - Blender 2.49 -----------------------------------------------------

While Blender is running, open a text editor and load the script ("open text
 block" button) "blender2cal3d.py". Read through the script and make any
 desired changes. Run the script (Alt + P) and follow the export dialogs
 which appear.

# NOTES
 This script is not being actively developed. For newer versions, one should
 use the Blender 2.5X-compatible script.
